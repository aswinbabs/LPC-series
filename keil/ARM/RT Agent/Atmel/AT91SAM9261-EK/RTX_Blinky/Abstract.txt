This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Two LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the two output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B

This example simulates step driver mode.

The BLINKY example program is available for target:

AT91SAM9261: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
             downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB)
             AT45DB642D (page is 1056 bytes)
             (used for target debugging and production)

Notes: 
  - If Debug is selected the code is loaded to External SDRAM 
    and debugging happens there, if Download to Flash Memory 
    is selected the code downloads to External DataFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for this version 
    to work as standalone. This is done by opening Bootloader 
    project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" button.

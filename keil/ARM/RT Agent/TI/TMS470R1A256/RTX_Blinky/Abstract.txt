The Blinky project is a simple program for the 'TMS470R1A256'
using the Texas Instruments 'TMS470R1A256' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 2 LEDs blink (one chases the other)

The Blinky program is available in:
  TMS470R1A256: configured for on-chip Flash ROM using 
                RT Agent for debugging 
                (used for target debugging)

IMPORTANT !!!
- R4 resistor (under the ARM-JTAG connector) has to be removed
  (unsoldered) to enable ULINK support, not necessary for ULINK2
- Jumpers on board TMS470R1A256 have to be set as follows:
  J_1.8V ON, J_3.3V ON, EN_L (1-2), AWD ON, TEST OFF, PLLDIS OFF
- When developing application never change protection keys
- NEVER USE 0x00000000 VALUES FOR MEMORY PROTECTION KEYS BECAUSE 
  THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE AFTER THAT, AND CAN NOT BE 
  ERASED OR PROGRAMMED ANY MORE

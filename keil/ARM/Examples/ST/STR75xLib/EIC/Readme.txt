Example description
===================
This example demontrates the use of the Enhanced Interrupt Controller (EIC): 

- Configuration of 3 TIM (TIM0..TIM2)timers to generate an interrupt on each 
  counter update event.
- The three timers are linked to their correspondant Update IRQ channel.
- Assignment of a ascendant IRQ priority for each IRQ channel :
  TIM0 has a priority of 1 and TIM2 has a priority of 3.
- In each interrupt routine: 
   - TIM0 toggles a led connected to P2.18 pin each 1s 
   - TIM1 toggles a led connected to P2.19 pin each 2s 
   - TIM2 toggles a led connected to P0.16 pin each 3s 

      
Directory contents
==================
75x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
75x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
main.c      Main program


Hardware environment
====================
Connect three leds to pins P2.18, P2.19 and P0.16(respectively LD4, LD5 and LD3
on STR75x-EVAL board).
   
     
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + 75x_lib.c
  + 75x_gpio.c
  + 75x_mrcc.c
  + 75x_tim.c
  + 75x_eic.c
  + 75x_cfg.c
          
- Link all compiled files and load your image into either RAM or Flash
- Run the example

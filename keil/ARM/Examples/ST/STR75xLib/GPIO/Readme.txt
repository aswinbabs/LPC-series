Example description
===================
This example provides a short description of how to use the GPIO peripheral and
gives a configuration sequence. It shows also how to use the bit mask feature.
Four leds connected to P2.18, P2.19, P1.01 and P0.16 pins are toggled in an 
infinite loop.


Directory contents
==================
75x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
75x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
main.c      Main program


Hardware environment
====================
 - Connect four leds to pins P2.18, P2.19, P1.01 and P0.16(respectively LD4,LD5,
   LD2 and LD3 on STR75x-EVAL board).
   
     
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + 75x_lib.c
  + 75x_gpio.c
  + 75x_mrcc.c
      
- Link all compiled files and load your image into either RAM or Flash
- Run the example

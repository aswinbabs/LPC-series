Example description
===================
This example demonstrates how to boot on the external Serial Flash connected to
SMI Bank0.
The system clock is set to 48MHz and the SMI runs at 48MHz (SMI_PRESC = 1) with
Fast Read mode enabled.
The executed program toggles four led connected to P2.18, P2.19, P1.01 and P0.16
pins.

      
Directory contents
==================
75x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
75x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
main.c         Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on the STR75x-EVAl board and use the M25P64 SPI FLASH.

     
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- In the 75x_init.s file enable the 'SMI_Bank0_EN' define 
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + 75x_lib.c
  + 75x_gpio.c
  + 75x_mrcc.c
  + 75x_smi.c
          
- Link all compiled files and load your image into the external Flash
- Run the example

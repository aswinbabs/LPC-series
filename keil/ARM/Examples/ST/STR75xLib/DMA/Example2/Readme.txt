Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to use DMA Stream3 with ADC request
to transfer Data from an ADC Data register to a TIM0 Output Compare register.
ADC Channel3 is converted continuously with a frequency equal to 333.33KHz 
DMA capability is enabled for Channel3. TIM0 used in PWM mode, run with a 
frequency of 70.75KHz and Output Compare2 is enabled.
The DMA Stream3 is configured in Circular mode to transfer 16 bits data from
ADC_D3 register to TIM0_OCR2 register continuously.
Once the DMA Stream3 is enabled, each time a conversion of Channel3 is finished 
a transfer of the last converted value is done to fill the TIM0_OCR2 register. 
This will change the TIM0 output compare2 signal duty cycle. The TIM0_OC2 output
drives a led luminosity according to the value converted by the ADC.


Directory contents
==================
75x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
75x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
main.c      Main program


Hardware environment
====================
 - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel3 mapped on pin P0.17
   (potentiometer RV2 on STR75x-EVAL board) 
 - Connect TIM0_OC2 pin (P1.00) to a led.
 
 
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + 75x_lib.c
  + 75x_adc.c
  + 75x_dma.c
  + 75x_gpio.c
  + 75x_mrcc.c
  + 75x_tim.c
  + 75x_cfg.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into either RAM or Flash
- Run the example

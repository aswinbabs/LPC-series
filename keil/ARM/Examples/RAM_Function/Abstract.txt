The RAM_Function program demonstrates how to define a function that
executes in RAM. This may be useful for IAP Flash programming or to 
improve to the performance with slow external Flash devices.

Functions that are be executed in RAM should reside in a seperate
source module. Using the 'Options for File' dialog you can simply change
the 'Code / Const' area of a module to a memory space in physical RAM.

Available memory areas are declared in the 'Target' tab of the
'Options for Target' dialog.

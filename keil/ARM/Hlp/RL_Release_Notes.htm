<h2><a name="WhatsNew"></a>What's New in RL-ARM Real-Time Library</h2>

<p>The following sections list the changes instituted in each release of the RL-ARM.</p>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 4.00</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: a <b>tsk_lock</b> problem in <b>ARM</b> library. After a tick
        timer interrupt was disabled, the interrupt was not immediatelly blocked but
	a few cycles later. Therefore in some rare situations (very timing specific) 
	it could happen that a blocked interrupt was still executed which eventually 
	lead to RTX failure. 
      </li>
      <li>Updated: RTX configuration files for STMicroelectronics <b>STR71x</b>, 
        <b>STR73x</b> and <b>STR75x</b> devices. Older RTX_Config.c files have to be
	replaced.
      </li>
      <li>Corrected: a SVC_Handler problem in <b>Cortex-M1</b> library. The function
        return value was wrong. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>  

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.80</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: two problems in <b>ARM</b> library: 
        <ul>
	  <li>Frequently calling <b>isr_xxx</b> functions from interrupt handlers
	    has disturbed (shortened) the system delays and timeouts for <b>os_xxx</b>
	    functions with delays.
          <li>Corrected re-entrance problem of <b>isr_xxx</b> functions when called 
	    from <b>os_tmr_call</b> user timer callback function.
          </li>
	</ul>   
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>  

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.70</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: RTX configuration for Atmel <b>AT91SAM9260</b> devices. Preconfigured
        <b>RTX_Blinky</b> example for the Atmel AT91SAM9260-EK evaluation board
        can be found in <b>..\ARM\Boards\Atmel\AT91SAM9260-EK</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: several problems in <b>Cortex-M</b> library: 
        <ul>
	  <li>The <b>_alloc_box</b> and <b>_free_box</b> functions have re-enabled 
	    globally disabled interrupts.
	  <li>When deleting the preceeding task (by order of TID's), the
	    <b>os_tsk_delete</b> function has deleted the current running task 
	    instead. 
          <li>The system might incorrectly execute <b>svc</b> system calls in a 
	    very rare timing sequences when followed by the SysTick timer interrupt.   
	</ul>   
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>  

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.50 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for Luminary <b>LM3S9Bxx</b> devices. Preconfigured
        <b>RTX_Blinky</b> example for the Luminary EK-LM3S9Bxx evaluation board
        can be found in <b>..\ARM\Boards\Luminary\EK-LM3S9Bxx</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.46 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RL - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: a <b>product version</b> number in <b>RTL.h</b>. It is encoded 
        in decimal format. For RL-ARM version 3.46 it is defined as: 
<pre>
#define __RL_ARM_VER    346
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for Toshiba <b>TMPA910</b> device. <b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.40 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RL - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: the <b>S8</b> type definition in <b>RTL.h</b>. It has been 
         changed from plain <b>char</b> to a <b>signed char</b>. Plain char is 
	 defined as an unsigned byte by default.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced: the RTX core to support a <b>multithreading</b> for the standard 
        runtime library:
	<ul>
	 <li>provides a separate library space for each task,
	 <li>protects non thread safe library functions with mutexes.
	</ul>
	<b>Note:</b> The new RTX-V2 ARM library is rewritten, the <b>os_clock_demon()</b>
	task scheduler has been removed and replaced with the system function calls.
	New RTX-V2 library is faster and uses up to 300 bytes less ram.
      </li>
      <li>Added: the <b>__task</b> attribute. The __task attribute must be used
        in precedence to the function definition.
<pre>
<font color=#880000>__task</font> void display_control (void) {}   // correct usage
void display_control (void) <font color=#880000>__task</font> {}   // generates compiler error
</pre>
        The __task attribute saves up to 32 bytes of stack space per each task and
        saves a few instructions in the code.
      </li>
      <li>Updated: all RTX examples for the new RTX-V2 configuration and the new
        __task attribute definition.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.24 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for Atmel <b>AT91SAM9RL</b> device. <b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.22e Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for Freescale <b>i.MX27</b> device. <b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added. Preconfigured examples for the
	Phytec PHYCORE-i.MX27 evaluation board can be found in 
	<b>..\ARM\Boards\Phytec\i.MX27</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.22b Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: a mailbox problem in <b>ARM</b> library. The message
        sent from <b>os_mbx_send</b> function was lost if slot was not available in 
	a mailbox and function returned a timeout status.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.22a Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: problem in <b>Cortex-M</b> library which was introduced in version 3.22 
        (re-entrance of <b>isr_xxx</b> functions).
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.22 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: re-entrance problem of <b>isr_xxx</b> functions in <b>Cortex-M</b>
        library when using nested interrupts.
      </li>
      <li>Corrected: a mailbox problem in <b>Cortex-M</b> library. A message sent to 
        a mailbox from an interrupt handler was lost in some rare timing situations. 
      </li>
      <li>Corrected: a timing problem in <b>ARM</b> library. When <b>isr_xxx()</b> functions
        were called from more than one interrupt handler with a very high repetition rate,
        system delays might expire sooner than expected. This has happened because
        the RTX kernel has detected a false tick timer overflow and decremented timeouts 
	also within an interval time.
      </li>
      <li>Corrected: wrong <b>task priority</b> handling of the <b>mutex owner</b> task.
        When the <b>priority inversion</b> has been applied to a task which was the owner
	of the mutex, the original task's priority might not have been restored correctly.
      </li>
      <li>Corrected: range checking in <b>Cortex-M</b> library for <b>__svc</b> functions.
        The __svc function with the highest svc number would never execute because
	of wrong svc range checking.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.21 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for Cortex-M3 <b>RTX Event Viewer</b>. It allows task execution
      and task switch monitoring in real-time.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected: generation of HardFault Exception in <b>Cortex-M</b> library when
        user timers were enabled. The configuration file <b>RTX_Conf_CM.c</b> has been
        updated. Older configuration file is not compatible and need to be replaced
        with a new version.
      </li>
      <li>Corrected: invalid return value of create task functions for <b>Cortex&trade;M</b> 
        library. Functions <b>os_tsk_create_user()</b> and <b>os_tsk_create_user_ex()</b></b>
	have returned wrong task ID value. 
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.20 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RL-ARM]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Changed: the <a href=http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/rlarm/rlarm_lib_files.htm><b>
        library names</b></a> to be consistent with the Endianess type. RTX libraries are 
        automatically included by &microVision IDE, other libraries need to be included manually 
        into the project.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated: the RTX library for <b>Cortex-M</b> devices. In the new library the
        system calls (all os_xxx functions) are executed in <b>svc</b> mode and extended
        features of Cortex-M devices for RTOS support are used. The library is more
        roboust and fail-proof. New concept allows tasks to run in <b>protected</b>
        (unpriviliged) mode. The task <b>run mode</b> (priviliged or unpriviliged) is
        selectable from the config file.<br><br>
        <b>Note:</b> The code from old RTX projects is <b>compatible</b> to the new
        library, however old configuration files need to be <b>replaced</b> with the new 
        </b>RTX_Conf_CM.c</b> file and old startup files updated with access to
        <b>SVC_Handler</b>, <b>PendSV_Handler</b> and <b>SysTick_Handler</b> exception
        handlers.<br><br>
<pre>
                <font color=#880000>IMPORT  SVC_Handler
                IMPORT  PendSV_Handler
                IMPORT  SysTick_Handler</font>
                
Vectors         ..
                <font color=#880000>DCD     SVC_Handler             ; SVCall Handler</font>
                DCD     Default_Handler         ; Debug Monitor Handler
                DCD     0                       ; Reserved

                ..
</pre>   
      </li>
      <li>Added: support for Texas Instruments <b>TMS470R1B1M</b> device. <b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added. Preconfigured examples for TMS470R1B1M  
        evaluation board can be found in <b>..\ARM\Boards\TI\TMS470R1B1M</b> folder.
      </li>
      <li>Added: support for NXP <b>LPC3180</b> device. <b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added. Preconfigured examples for Phytec LPC3180  
        evaluation board can be found in <b>..\ARM\Boards\Phytec\LPC3180</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: core problems for <b>Cortex-M</b> devices. Handling of <b>isr_xxx</b>
        function calls was incorrect and could cause task locks. Wrong handling of task switches
        and <b>__svc</b> functions could cause sporadic application crashes if additional
        user interrupts were enabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RL-ARM Version 3.12 Release</h3>

        <b>LPC2106 RS232 QSB</b>, <b>LPC2129 CAN QSB</b>, <b>LPC2138 QSB</b> and <b>LPC2148 USB QSB</b>.
        RTX_Blinky examples can be found in <b>..\ARM\Boards\Embedded Artists</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTX - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a task timing problem for STmicroelectronics <b>STR750</b> devices in <b>RTX_Config.c</b>
        configuration file. Interrupt function calls of <b>isr_xxx()</b> has reset also the hardware tick 
        timer prescaler and changed the tick-timer timing cycle. This is now fixed in a new RTX 
        configuration file.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 3.05 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTL-ARM]</b></font><br>

    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced: handling of <b>isr_xxx()</b> functions to increase execution speed and preformance.
      <li>Updated: task create functions <b>os_tsk_create_user()</b> and <b>os_tsk_create_user_ex()</b>.
        Those functions now autocorrect user provided stack size for 8-byte stack alignment.
      <li>Improved: RTX configuration for <b>STR71x</b>, <b>STR73x</b> and <b>STR75x</b> devices. 
        Standard RTX configuration no longer needs a <b>SWI_Table.s</b> System function <b>__swi(8)</b> from
        RTX_Config.c has been changed to <b>__swi(7)</b> which does not require an external SWI_Table 
        included into the project anymore.
    </ul>

  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of <b>isr_sem_send()</b> function. This function did not work correctly when 
        a task was already waiting for a semaphore and might hold a task in <b>WAIT_SEM</b> state for 
        additional 65536 system tick intervals.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 3.04 Release</h3>

<ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a core problem of <b>SWI_Handler</b> when accessing user registers. Setting an user 
        Link Register on task switch has failed for Atmel <b>AT91RM9200</b> devices. Instruction 
        <b>LDMDB SP,{SP,LR}^</b> does not work for these devices. Implemented workaround uses 
        a different instruction for setting the user LR and this works for all ARM devices.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of <b>os_tsk_prio()</b> function. This function did not work correctly
        when a priority of a task in a delay has been changed.

      </li>
      <li>Updated: RTOS configuration files for Atmel <b>SAM7S, SAM7A3, SAM7X</b> and <b>SAM79261</b> 
        devices. In addition to PIT timer, also TC0, TC1 and TC2 timer counter blocks can be selected
        as a system tick timer. Also a Common System Interrupt Handler is added. It can be used when a 
        PIT timer is selected as an RTOS tick timer which shares a common IRQ with other SAM7 system
        peripherals.
      </li>
      <li>Updated: RTOS configuration files for Analog Devices <b>ADuC702X</b> devices and OKI 
        <b>ML67Q4003</b>, <b>ML67Q5003</b> and <b>ML674000</b> devices. The code from assembly 
        Interrupt Handler module <b>IRQ.s</b> has been integrated into </b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration file. This module is nomore required for RTOS projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Note</b>: All RTOS configuration files <B>RTX_Config.c</B> from Startup folder have been 
    updated and optimized. It is advised to replace older RTOS configurations with new configurations.

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 3.03 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTL-ARM]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for Atmel <b>AT91SAM7X</b> device. <b> RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added. Preconfigured examples for AT91SAM7X-EK Atmel
        evaluation board can be found in <b>..\ARM\RV30\RTL\Boards\Atmel</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: a <b>mutex</b> task priority inversion - <b>priority inheritance</b> has been 
        implemented. When a medium-priority task preempts a lower-priority task using a shared 
        resource (a mutex) on which a higher-priority task is pending, a priority of lower-priority 
        task is temporary raised to the priority level of a higher-priority task. As soon as a 
        lower-priority task releases a mutex, a priority level of this task is lowered back to a default value.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a problem in <b>RTX_Config.c</b> for all Atmel devices. Interrupt acknowledge 
        sequence was incorrect and could cause <b>system dead-locks</b> when additional IRQ 
        interrupts were enabled. If <b>isr_xxx_</b> functions were called from the interrupt 
        handler, the interrupt system might not be properly released and would not accept
        any further tick-timer interrupts.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: a problem in <b>RTX_Config.c</b> for STMicroelectronics STR91x devices.
        A code to disable interrupts was incorrect. Because of this problem a tick timer 
        interrupt could happen in a protected section of RTX Kernel system code following 
        with a stack overflow and user application crash.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 3.02 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTL-ARM]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for STMicroelectronics <b>STR912</b> device. <b>RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel was added. Preconfigured examples for MCBSTR9 Keil 
        evaluation board can be found in <b>..\ARM\RV30\RTL\Boards\Keil</b> folder.
      </li>
      <li>Added: support for Atmel <b>AT91RM9200</b> and <b>AT91SAM9261</B> devices. <b>RTX_Config.c</b>
        configurations for RTX kernel were added. Preconfigured examples for AT91RM9200-EK and AT91SAM9261-EK
        Atmel evaluation boards can be found in <b>..\ARM\RV30\RTL\Boards\Atmel</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a <b>mutex</b> task deadlock problem. When a task with higher priority would
        release and again grab a mutex, a lower priority task would become ready. Because of a
        mutex problem, this task would never get a chance to execute, not even after a timeout.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 3.01 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTL-ARM]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>RTL object libraries and examples are reconfigured and recompiled for 
        Compiler optimization level O3.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: support for STMicroelectronics <b>STR912</b> device. <b> RTX_Config.c</b> 
        configuration for RTX kernel and <b>STR9_ENET.c</b> driver for embedded ENET ethernet
        controller were added. Preconfigured examples for MCBSTR9 Keil evaluation board can be 
        found in <b>..\ARM\RV30\RTL\Boards\Keil</b> folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 3.00 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[RTL-ARM]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated: all references to legacy term 'Advanced' are removed. Include definition files
        renamed to <b>RTL.h</b>, <b>RTX_Config.h</b>, <b>Net_Config.h</b>. The configuration
        files are also renamed to <b>RTX_Config.c</b>, <b>Net_Config.c</b>, <b>Net_Debug.c</b>.
        The documetation is updated to reflect those changes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a problem in <b>RTX_Config.c</b> for ST Microelectronics <b>STR71x</b> device family.
        If the device was running with a high speed system clock but the EIC peripheral with a slower 
        PCLK2 clock, the interrupts were not disabled immediately when an interrupt enable register was 
        written but with a delay. Because of this problem a tick timer interrupt might occur in a protected 
        region of code. This collision has caused an RTX Kernel malfunctioning or even user application crash. 
        The fix uses a swi function <b>__swi(8)</b> which is no more free for the user.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: a problem in <b>RTX_Config.c</b> for Analog Devices <b>ADuC702x</b> device family. 
        The problem was in a device inability to mask forced-programming software interrupts.
        Because of this problem a tick timer interrupt could happen in a protected section of
        RTX Kernel system code following with a stack overflow and user application crash.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of potential application crash when a project was build with
        RealView compiler <b>optimization</b> level other than O0. This was because the 
        registers <b>R8-R11</b> were not stored for reduced context switch. Now the reduced
        context switch save also registers R8-R11 on the stack.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Warning</b>: A configuration file <B>RTX_Config.c</B> is not compatible to older versions 
    and need to be replaced. If the old configuration is used, the application
    will <b>crash</b> because the initial task stack content is not compatible
    anymore.
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 2.11 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of wrong operation of <b>os_mbx_send()</b> when a message has 
        been fetched from a full mailbox and then pushed back again from the same task with
        no task switch in between. If another task has been waiting to send a message to this
        mailbox, this task would become ready and would send a message to a mailbox, which 
        was full with no space for free messages.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>RTL-ARM Version 2.10 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Ported to RealView Compilation Tools environment.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of potential system hang when <b>os_mbx_send()</b>
        was called with parameter timeout set to 0. If a mailbox was already
        full a system could hang in an endless loop.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of wrong operation of <b>os_mut_wait()</b> when a
        mutex was released and acquired again with no delay in between. If
        another task has been waiting for this mutex, this task would become
        ready and acquire a mutex, which was already owned by another task.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of failed Round Robin task switching. This problem has shown when 
        a higher priority tasks were also running in addition. If a higher priority task was delayed by 
        <b>os_dly_wait()</b> or <b>os_itv_wait()</b> function with a delay time equal to Round Robin timeout
        or less than this timeout, a Round Robin task switching did not work.
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>ARTX Version 2.00 Release</h3>

<ul>
 <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[ARTX - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: new type definitions to <b> ARTX.h</b> header file to avoid conflicts. 
        New types are: U8, U16, U32, S8, S16, S32, BIT, BOOL, __TRUE and __FALSE. New types
        have replaced old types: BYTE, WORD, DWORD, TRUE and FALSE. Source files
        and documentation has been modified to reflect those changes.
      </li> 
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: new synchronization object <b>mutex</b> for mutual exclusion locks. The following
        functions were implemented: <b>os_mut_init()</b>, <b>os_mut_wait()</b> and <b>os_mut_release()</b>.
      </li>
      <li>Added: Stack Checking option to <b>ARTX_Config.c</b> configuration file. When this option is
        enabled, ARTX Kernel executes additional code to check for stack-overflow error.
      </li>
      <li>Added: new functions <b>os_sys_init_user()</b> which allows to start the ARTX Kernel
        with a task which has assigned an user-provided stack and <b>os_sys_init_prio()</b>
        which allows you to start the ARTX Kernel with a task which will have
        assigned a specified priority.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: a potential problem of blocking the interrupt system for some of the ARM devices.
        This could happen if the default interrupt handler <b>os_def_interrupt()</b>
        has been executed. This handler located
        in <b>ARTX_Config.c</b> configuration file has now been updated to release the ARM interrupt
        system by acknowledging the interrupt.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: a problem of wrong interval delay when execution between <b>os_itv_set()</b> and
        <b>os_itv_wait()</b> takes more clock ticks than specified with <b> os_itv_set()</b> function.
        This problem is shown with the following example:
<pre>
void task1 (void) __task {
    .
    .
   os_itv_set (100);
   for (;;) {
       .
       .
      /* Execution here may take longer than 100 clock ticks.   */
      os_itv_wait ();  /* If 100 clock ticks have passed,       */
                       /* this will wait for 65535 clock ticks. */
   }
}
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    A configuration file <B>ARTX_Config.c</B> is not compatible to older versions 
    and need to be replaced.
</ul>

<h3>ARTX Version 1.10 Release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Enhancements]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added: <b>os_evt_get()</b> event handling function, which returns 
        event flags served by the <b>os_evt_wait_or()</b> function.
      </li>
      <li>Added: several examples were added to <b>Keil\ARM\ARTX\Examples</b> base folder:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Keil\ARM\ARTX\Examples\RoundRobin</b>: shows round-robin task switching.</li>
        <li><b>Keil\ARM\ARTX\Examples\Semaphore</b>: shows how to use a shared resource
          UART
          from different tasks using a semaphore.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li><font color="#800000" size="1"><b>[Kernel - Problems Solved]</b></font><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed: configuration problem of tick timer reload in <b>ARTX_Config.C</b> configuration
       files for OKI and ST devices variants. Improper tick timer reload could 
       cause stalls in Kernel delay handling when isr_mbx_send(), isr_evt_set() and 
       isr_sem_send() functions were used. 
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: core problem of invalid delays when frequent <b>isr_xxx_xxx</b> function
       calls were made from interrupt functions. This could cause shorter delays than 
       specified for os_dly_wait(), os_itv_wait() and other system delay and timeout functions.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed: problem in <b>os_mbx_wait()</b> and <b>os_sem_wait()</b> functions when they were 
       called with <i>timeout</i>  parameter set to 0. In this case the function
        has returned wrong result value. The <i>timeout</i> value 0 is used to fetch a message
       or obtain a token from a semaphore without waiting for one.
      </li>
      <li>Modified: <b>ARTX_Config.C</b> configuration files for all device variants. 
       The function <b>os_tmr_set_ovf()</b> has been replaced with <b>os_tmr_force_irq()</b>
       function. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  A configuration file <b>ARTX_Config.c</b> is not compatible to older versions and
  need to be replaced.
</ul>

<h3>ARTX Version 1.02 Release</h3>

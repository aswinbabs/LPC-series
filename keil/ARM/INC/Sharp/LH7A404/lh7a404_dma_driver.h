 *     LH7A404
 *
 * Notes:
 *     DMA memory to memory operations are not yet implemented. These
 *     will be implemented in a later version of this driver.

/* This type is a function pointer to a callback function the DMA
   driver will call when it needs more data to keep the DMA stream
   going. This function type is only used with the dmac_start_using_cb()
   function when starting DMA transfers that use callbacks. For a user
   of this driver function, another function needs to be defined with
   the following prototype. For a receive and transmit channel, this
   function requires slightly different arguments:
   For transmit:
       Argument 1 is a pointer to a buffer to get data from the
           callback
       Argument 2 is a pointer to a UNS_32. The value contains the
           number of bytes that were transferred in the last DMA
           transfer when calling the callback function. The value will
           contain the number of bytes to transfer in the buffer when
           returning from the callback function. This value should never
           be more than 64KBytes and should be a multiple of 4.
       Argument 3 is a pointer to a boolean flag. The flag value will
           be sent as TRUE to the callback if the DMA transfer was
           aborted due to an error. The callback must return the flag
           as TRUE if it wants to abort the transfer.
   For receive:
       Argument 1 is a pointer to a buffer that is allocated by the
           callback function. The DMA data will be placed into this
           area.
       Argument 2 is a pointer to a UNS_32. The value contains the
           number of bytes that were transferred in the last DMA
           transfer when calling the callback function. The value will
           contain the number of bytes to transfer in the buffer when
           returning from the callback function. This value should never
           be more than 64KBytes and should be a multiple of 4.
       Argument 3 is a pointer to a boolean flag. The flag value will
           be sent as TRUE to the callback if the DMA transfer was
           aborted due to an error. The callback must return the flag
           as TRUE if it wants to abort the transfer. */

 * Project: LH7A404 SDMMC driver
 *
 * Description:
 *     This file contains basic driver support for the SDMMC module
 *     on the LH7A404
 *
 * Notes:
 *     This driver supports basic MMC and SD data transfer capability
 *     and is intended to be a reference on how the SDMMC interface of
 *     the LH7A404 works. This driver can be used to transfer data to
 *     and from an MMC card, but not every SDMMC function is implemented
 *     and a system with an SD/MMC interface may require more capability
 *     than what this driver provides. The following is provided by this
 *     driver:
 *         SDMMC multi-block read and write
 *         Interrupt and DMA control and transfer modes
 *         Device status and detection (via OCR polling)
 *         SDMMC state management
 *    Although support for multiple SD/MMC cards is provided, it may
 *    not work correctly 'as is' when accessing multiple cards at the
 *    same time. Making some operations atomic may help fix this.
 *
 *    This driver requires state management in the interrupt handler.
 *    Some IOCTL commands request data from the MMC card or interface
 *    that isn't immediately available. To keep the driver from using
 *    delay and monitor loops and delaying external applications, the
 *    driver will usually take a request without providing an immediate
 *    result. The user application needs to keep this in mind and check
 *    the status of the operation at a time after the initial request.

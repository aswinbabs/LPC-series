This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which:
 - simulates the step-motor driver
   - four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of the 
     four output driver stages (phase A, phase B, phase C, phase D)
 - demonstrates HET (High End Timer) working in interrupt mode 
   for generating PWM (shown on LED L15) 
 - uses push button (B1) detection by using GIO interrupt
   - LED L7 toggles when interrupt is registered

The BLINKY example program is available for target:

  TMS470R1B1M Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                     (used for production or target debugging)

NOTES:
- clean project does not show HET.c because it will be generated 
  after first project build (by HET assembly)

IMPORTANT !!!
- R4 resistor (under the ARM-JTAG connector) has to be removed
  (unsoldered) to enable ULINK support, not necessary for ULINK2
- Jumpers on board TMS470R1B1M_A have to be set as follows:
  J_1.9V ON, J_3.3V ON, EXT (1-2), AWD ON, TEST OFF, PLLDIS OFF
- When developing application never change protection keys
- NEVER USE 0x00000000 VALUES FOR MEMORY PROTECTION KEYS BECAUSE 
  THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE AFTER THAT, AND CAN NOT BE 
  ERASED OR PROGRAMMED ANY MORE

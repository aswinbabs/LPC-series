The Blinky project is a simple program for the 'TMS470R1B1M'
using the Texas Instruments 'TMS470R1B1M' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - SYSCLK = XTAL*8/1 = 60.0 MHz
   - ICLK   = SYSCLK/8 =  7.5 MHz
 - LED L15 blinks with PWM generated with HET, used with 
   interrupt
 - LED L7 toggles by pressing button B1, used with interrupt
 - LED is blinking from LED L1 to LED L6 and circulates
 - bargraph is shown on text LCD according to analog value 
   (potentiometer AN_TR)

The Blinky program is available in:
  TMS470R1B1M Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                        (used for production or target debugging)
  TMS470R1B1M RT_Agent: configured for on-chip Flash ROM using 
                        RT Agent for debugging 
                        (used for target debugging)

NOTES:
- clean project does not show HET.c because it will be generated 
  after first project build (by HET assembly)

IMPORTANT !!!
- R4 resistor (under the ARM-JTAG connector) has to be removed
  (unsoldered) to enable ULINK support, not necessary for ULINK2
- Jumpers on board TMS470R1B1M_A have to be set as follows:
  J_1.9V ON, J_3.3V ON, EXT (1-2), AWD ON, TEST OFF, PLLDIS OFF
- When developing application never change protection keys
- NEVER USE 0x00000000 VALUES FOR MEMORY PROTECTION KEYS BECAUSE 
  THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE AFTER THAT, AND CAN NOT BE 
  ERASED OR PROGRAMMED ANY MORE

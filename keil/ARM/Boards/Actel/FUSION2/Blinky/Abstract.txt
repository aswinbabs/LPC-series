The Blinky project is a simple program for the Cortex-M3 on 
'Actel A2F200' FPGA using 
'Actel FUSION2 DEVELOPMENT BOARD' and is compliant to the Cortex 
Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

It just blinks the user LED with 1 second interval.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL   =  50 MHz
 - SYSCLK = 100 MHz

The Blinky program is available in target:
  A2FM3 Flash:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:
  - set jumper JP7  to position 2-3
  - set jumper JP10 to position 2-3

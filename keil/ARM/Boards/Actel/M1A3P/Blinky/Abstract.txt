The Blinky project is a simple example program for Cortex-M1 using
an Actel Cortex-M1 enabled ProASIC3 Development Kit (M1A3P).

Example is based on the Sample System Hardware design provided by Actel
(Cortex-M1 with External Flash & SRAM, Interrupts, GPIO, Timer, UART).

Details about the Sample Hardware design and Actel tools are provided
on the M1A3P-DEV-KIT CD.

Note:
Sample Hardware design with standard ARM JTAG debug port must be programmed
into the FPGA device by using Actel tools (M1A3P is shipped with the Sample
Hardware design which uses FlashPro3 UJTAG debug port).

The program blinks the user LEDs (U8) on the Development Board.
Running light is controlled via SW2 #1 and speed via SW2 #2.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  M1A3P Flash &  Board Configuration = SW2 #9 ON (Flash @ 0):
     runs from External Flash located on board
     (used for production or target debugging)
  M1A3P SRAM  &  Board Configuration = SW2 #9 OFF (SRAM @ 0):
     runs from External SRAM located on board
     (may be used for target debugging)

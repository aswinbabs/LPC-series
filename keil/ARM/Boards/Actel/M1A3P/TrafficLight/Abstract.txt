The Traffic Light project is an example program for Cortex-M1 using
an Actel Cortex-M1 enabled ProASIC3 Development Kit (M1A3P).

Example is based on the Sample System Hardware design provided by Actel
(Cortex-M1 with External Flash & SRAM, Interrupts, GPIO, Timer, UART).

Details about the Sample Hardware design and Actel tools are provided
on the M1A3P-DEV-KIT CD.

Note:
Sample Hardware design with standard ARM JTAG debug port must be programmed
into the FPGA device by using Actel tools (M1A3P is shipped with the Sample
Hardware design which uses FlashPro3 UJTAG debug port).

Example demonstrates the Cortex-M1 system executing a traffic light
sequence to blink LEDs. It will also transmit control characters through
the UART to an optional Traffic Light application running on a PC.

To run the Traffic Light application on the PC first connect the USB port
on the PC to the USB Serial Port (J2) on the board and istall the required
drivers (provided by Actel). Then determine the COM port number by searching
the Device Manager for "SFE USB to RS232" under Ports (COM & LPT). Then run
the application Traffic_Light and select the appropriate COM Port.

The Traffic Light program is available in different targets:
  M1A3P Flash &  Board Configuration = SW2 #9 ON (Flash @ 0):
     runs from External Flash located on board
     (used for production or target debugging)
  M1A3P SRAM  &  Board Configuration = SW2 #9 OFF (SRAM @ 0):
     runs from External SRAM located on board
     (may be used for target debugging)

The Blinky project is a simple program for the Freescale 
MAC7111 microcontroller using 'MAC7100 Evaluation Board 2003' 
Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - analog conversion of value from potentiometer 
 - circulating LED with PIT3 timer in interrupt mode, 
   time of LED circulation is determined by AD value


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  MAC7111 - Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  MAC7111 - RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (may be used for target debugging)

Note: - DIP Switch SW1 has to be set like following:
        MODEA  = 0 (ON),  MODEB   = 0 (ON),  XCLKS   = 1 (OFF), 
        PSIZ   = 1 (OFF), AUTO-TA = 1 (OFF), NEX-LOC = 0 (ON),
        NEX-EN = 0 (ON),  TPVI    = 1 (OFF)

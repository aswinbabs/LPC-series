The Blinky project is a simple program for the S3F4A0KR
using Samsung 'S3F4A0K EVA BD' Evaluation Board and 
demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - PLL              = 40   MHz
   - CORECLK          = 40   MHz
   - GICCLK = PCLK    = 10   MHz
 - 4 LEDs blink from left to right and back
   - Simple Timer 1 is used in interrupt mode
     (interrupt happens every 10 ms)
 - pressing button SW1 speeds up led blinking
 - pressing button SW2 slows down up led blinking
 
The Blinky program is available for target:
  S3F4A0K Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

Note: When low power clock is used chip must be reset 
      manually and flash programming must be started 
      within approximately 2 second after power-on.

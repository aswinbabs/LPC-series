This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

This example needs a 2-level Bootloader from Keil to be 
loaded in NAND Flash.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation

S3C2440:   Samsung S3C2440 with ULINK debugger
           - Application is loaded to external NAND Flash 
             and executes from external SDRAM

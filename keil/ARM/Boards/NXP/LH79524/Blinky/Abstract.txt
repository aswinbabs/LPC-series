The Blinky project is a simple program for the NXP 'LH79524' 
microcontroller using NXP 'SDKLH79524-10' evaluation board 
and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                     =  11.2896 MHz
   - PLL                      = 101.6064 MHz
   - SYS   = HCLK  = PLL / 2  =  50.8032 MHz
   - CPU   = FCLK  = PLL / 8  =  50.8032 MHz
 - 2 status LEDs blink (STATUS0, STATUS1) with speed 
   of 1 second, determined by Timer0 working in 
   interrupt mode
 
The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  LH79524 Int RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                         (may be used for target debugging)
  LH79524 Ext NOR Flash: runs from External NOR Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
  LH79524 Ext SDRAM:     configured for external SDRAM, 
                         (may be used for target debugging)

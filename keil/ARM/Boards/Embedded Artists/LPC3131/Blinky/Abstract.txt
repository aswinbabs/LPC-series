The Blinky project is a simple program for the LPC2478
using Embedded Artists boards:
  Daughter Board - 'LPC313x OEM Board v1.0'
  Mother   Board - 'LPC31xx Base Board v1.1'
and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed of 1 second
   (LEDs are connected through I2C LED Dimmer (PCA9532))

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL                      =  12.00 MHz
 - HP1 PLL                   = 180.00 MHz
 - processor clock = HP1 PLL = 180.00 MHz
 - AHB clock = HP1 PLL / 2   =  90.00 MHz

Memories:
 - Internal RAM              - 192 kB (adr: 0x11028000, 0x11040000)
 - External SDRAM            -  64 MB (adr: 0x30000000)
 - External NAND Flash       - 256 MB
 - External SPI NOR Flash    -   4 MB

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  LPC3131 Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                     downloaded to external NAND Flash (256MB)
                     (used for target debugging and production)

Notes: 
  - For "LPC3131 Ext SDRAM" target if Debug is selected 
    the code is loaded to External SDRAM and debugging happens 
    there, if Download to Flash Memory is selected the code 
    downloads to External NAND Flash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "LPC3131 Ext SDRAM"
    version to work as standalone. This is done by opening 
    Bootloader project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" 
    button.
  - For NAND Flash booting jumpers BOOT0..2
    have to be set to GND

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on 
     "Download to Flash Memory" button
  2. Select "LPC3131 Ext SDRAM" target in this project and 
     click on "Download to Flash Memory" button
  3. Reset the board

The 2-nd level Bootloader for NXP 'LPC313x' 
device series (configured for External SDRAM 
and loaded to External NAND Flash on the 
'Embedded Artists LPC3131' Board)

This is a 2-nd level bootloader for NXP LPC313x 
device series (LPC3130, LPC3231) with External 
NAND Flash and External SDRAM. 
It downloads to BLOCK 1 (128 kB) of the NAND Flash.
The 1-st level bootloader that is in ROM of 
LPC313x first downloads this 2-nd level 
bootloader to internal RAM and starts it.

The 2-nd level bootloader's main function is to 
copy user program from the External NAND Flash 
to the External SDRAM and start it.

Just select Flash -> Download to download it 
to the NAND Flash.

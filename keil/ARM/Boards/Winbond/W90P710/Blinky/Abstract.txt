The Blinky project is a simple program for the Winbond 'W90P710' 
microcontroller using Winbond 'W90P710/W90N745 Application Board R1.2' 
evaluation board and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  15 MHz
   - PLL0  = 480 MHz
   - SYS   =  80 MHz
   - TCLK  =  15 MHz
 - 8 LEDs blink (LED8 .. LED15) with speed 
   of 1 second, determined by Timer1 working in 
   interrupt mode
 
The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  W90P710 Ext Boot Flash: runs from External Boot Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  W90P710 Ext SDRAM:      configured for external SDRAM, 
                          (may be used for target debugging)

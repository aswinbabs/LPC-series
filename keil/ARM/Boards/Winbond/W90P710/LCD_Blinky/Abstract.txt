The LCD_Blinky project is a simple program for the Winbond 'W90P710' 
microcontroller using Winbond 'W90P710/W90N745 Application Board R1.2' 
evaluation board and demonstrating interrupt functionality and 
display to graphic LCD.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  15 MHz
   - PLL0  = 480 MHz
   - SYS   =  80 MHz
   - TCLK  =  15 MHz
 - Displays rotating ARM 3D logo, each picture is displayed every 
   200 ms
 - 8 LEDs blink (LED8 .. LED15) with speed of 1 second, determined 
   by Timer1 working in interrupt mode
 
The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  W90P710 Ext Boot Flash: runs from External Boot Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  W90P710 Ext SDRAM:      configured for external SDRAM, 
                          (may be used for target debugging)

Notes: - In EVAL version of uVision do not rebuild the target as 
         this example's size exceeds EVAL version limitation

Picture conversion procedure:
1. Convert picture to 16 BPP (R - 5bits, G - 6bits, B - 5bits)
2. Remove header from bmp by hex editor, remaining file size should 
   be equal to (width * height * 2) bytes
3. Convert prepared file without header to C array

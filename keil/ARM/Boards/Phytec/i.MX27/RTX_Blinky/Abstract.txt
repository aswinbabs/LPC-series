This is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the 
Freescale 'MCIMX27' microcontroller using: 
- PHYTEC 'PCM-970' Baseboard PHYCORE-i.MX
- PHYTEC 'PMA-002-PHYMAP-i.MX27' Middle Board 
- PHYTEC 'PCM-038 PHYCORE-i.MX27' Daughter Board
which shows LED toggling every 1 second done by 
2 tasks (one turns LED ON and other turns LED OFF).

Clocks:   XTAL                     =  26.00 MHz 
          MPLL                     = 399.00 MHz 
          SPLL                     = 240.00 MHz 
          FCLK    = ((2*MPLL)/3)   = 266.00 MHz 
          HCLK    = ((2*MPLL)/3)/2 = 133.00 MHz 
          ARM CLK = FCLK           = 266.00 MHz
          AHB CLK = HCLK           = 133.00 MHz
          NFC CLK = HCLK / 6       =  22.16 MHz

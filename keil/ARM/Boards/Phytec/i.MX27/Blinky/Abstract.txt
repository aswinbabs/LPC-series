The 'Blinky' project is an simple example program for the  
Freescale 'MCIMX27' microcontroller using: 
- PHYTEC 'PCM-970' Baseboard PHYCORE-i.MX
- PHYTEC 'PMA-002-PHYMAP-i.MX27' Middle Board 
- PHYTEC 'PCM-038 PHYCORE-i.MX27' Daughter Board

Example functionality:
 - 1 LED blinks (GPIO), timing is generated with interrupt

Core Power (QVDD): 1.2V
Clocks:   XTAL                     =  26.00 MHz 
          MPLL                     = 399.00 MHz 
          SPLL                     = 240.00 MHz 
          FCLK    = ((2*MPLL)/3)   = 266.00 MHz 
          HCLK    = ((2*MPLL)/3)/2 = 133.00 MHz 
          ARM CLK = FCLK           = 266.00 MHz
          AHB CLK = HCLK           = 133.00 MHz
          NFC CLK = HCLK / 6       =  22.16 MHz
Memories: 128MB LP DDR SDRAM (adr: 0xA0000000)
          512KB SRAM
          64MB  NAND Flash
          32MB  NOR Flash    (adr: 0xC0000000)
          32KB  I2C EEPROM

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  MCIMX27 Int RAM:  configured for on-chip RAM
                    (may be used for target debugging)
  MCIMX27 Ext NOR:  configured for external NOR flash
                    (may be used for target debugging or 
                    production)
  MCIMX27 Ext SDRAM (NAND): configured to run in external 
                    SDRAM and loaded to external NAND flash
                    (may be used for target debugging or 
                    production)
  Download NAND Bootloader: this target is only used for 
                    download of prebuilt 2-nd level 
                    bootloader to NAND flash
  
Notes: 
  For Target 'MCIMX27 Ext SDRAM (NAND)' jumper 'Boot Mode/
  CLK-Sel.' (S5) has to be in position: 4,6,8 = ON, other = OFF
  2-nd level bootloader (from Keil) has to be downloaded to 
  NAND flash also (just select 'Download NAND Bootloader' 
  target and click on flash download, and prebuilt 
  bootloader will be downloaded to external NAND flash)

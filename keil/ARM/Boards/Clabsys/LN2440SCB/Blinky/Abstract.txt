The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the S3C2440 
using CLABSYS 'LN2440SBC' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
  - Clock Settings are used from bootloader:
    - XTAL    =            12.00 MHz
    - MPLL    =           300.00 MHz
    - UPLL    =            96.00 MHz
    - FCLK    = MPLL      300.00 MHz
    - HCLK    = FCLK/3  = 100.00 MHz
    - PCLK    = HCLK/2  =  50.00 MHz
    - UCLK    = UPLL/2  =  48.00 MHz
    - CAMCLK  = UPLL    =  96.00 MHz
  - 3 LEDs blink from left to right and back
    - Timer0 is used in interrupt mode
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:         configured for software Simulator
  S3C2440 Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM loaded 
                     to External NAND Flash (64MB)
                     (may be used for target debugging
                     or production)

Notes: 
  - JTAG connector has to be connected with custom made 
    connector to ULINK JTAG
  - for standalone application you have to:
    1. Download the 2-nd level bootloader 
       (from Keil) to NAND Flash 
    2. Download application built for 'Ext SDRAM' 
       target to NAND Flash

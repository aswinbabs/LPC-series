first downloads this 2-nd level bootloader to 
internal RAM and starts it.

2-nd level bootloader's main function is to copy the 
user program from NAND Flash to External SDRAM and 
start it.

Clock Settings:
  - XTAL             =  12 MHz
  - FCLK = MPLL      = 300 MHz
  - UCLK = UPLL / 2  =  48 MHz
  - HCLK = FCLK / 3  = 100 MHz
  - PCLK = HCLK / 2  =  50 MHz

Just select 'Flash -> Download', to download it 
to NAND Flash.

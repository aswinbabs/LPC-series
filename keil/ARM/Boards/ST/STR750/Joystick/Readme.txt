Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to use the USB on the STR75x devices.
The STR75x device is enumerated as an USB Joystick Mouse, that uses the native
PC Host USB HID driver.
The Joystick mounted on the STR75x-Eval board is used to emulate the Mouse
directions.

 - Ensure that the JP2 jumper is on position 1-2 
   

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files, the required Standard Library files,
  and all USB library files :
  + 75x_lib.c
  + 75x_gpio.c
  + 75x_mrcc.c
  + 75x_eic.c
  + 75x_cfg.c
  + usb_core.c
  + usb_int.c
  + usb_regs.c
  + usb_init.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into either RAM or Flash
- Run the example

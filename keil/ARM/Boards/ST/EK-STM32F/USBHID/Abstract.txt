The HID project is a demo program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using STMicroelectronics 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs
  - 3 Push Buttons (Key2,Key3), Joystick (Key4)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  EK-STM32F: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)

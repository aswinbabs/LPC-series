The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using STMicroelectronics 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board and 
demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
    Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LCD displays init message and AD value
    TIM4 refreshes LCD  
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
    USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD is used with DMA
    AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  EK-STM32F:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  EK-STM32F + OPT: EK-STM32F with Flash Options
                   (used for programming)

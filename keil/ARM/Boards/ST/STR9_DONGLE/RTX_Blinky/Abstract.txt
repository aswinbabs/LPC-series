This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Three LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the three output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation

STR9 Dongle: ST STR9_DONGLE Evaluation board with ULINK debugger
             - Application is loaded to internal Flash.

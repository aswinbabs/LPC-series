The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
and demonstrates interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - HSI     =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           48.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 48.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 24.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 48.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 =  8.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  6.00 MHz

 - LED blinks with speed depending on AD value
   - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
   USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD is used with DMA
   AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   configured for software Simulator
  CQ-STARM:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)

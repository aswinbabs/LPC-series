This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four output driver stages are used:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

The blinking LED shows the activation of the CLoCK task.

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  CQ-STARM:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

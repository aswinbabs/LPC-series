The 'Timer' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using CQ-STARM2, CQ-STARM BaseBoard and demonstrating 
the use of timer TIM1.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - Timer TIM1 is configured to generate an interrupt every 10 ms
 - displays the seconds on 7 segment display.
 
The Timer program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:    - configured for software Simulator
  CQ-STARM:     - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
  CQ-STARM SWV: - runs from Internal Flash located on chip 
                  configured for Trace. Shows variables DBG_secCnt, 
                  and DBG_msecCnt in LogicAnalyzer window.
                  applicable only in Target Debug Session using
                  ULINK2 or ULINK-ME.

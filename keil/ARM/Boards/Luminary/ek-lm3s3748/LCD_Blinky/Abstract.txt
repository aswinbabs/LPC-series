The LCD_Blinky project is a simple program for the Luminary 
'LM3S3748' microcontroller using 'Luminary LM3S3748 Evaluation 
Board'.

It blinks the Status LED and shows time and navigator 
states on OLED display.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 8.00 MHz
   - PLL not used 
   - SYS   = XTAL     = 8.00 MHz
 - LED STATUS toggles every 1 second
   (LED STATUS is connected to PF0)
 - Navigator position is shown on OLED display
 - If Navigator is pressed time is stopped

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in µVision Simulator
  LM3S3748 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)

This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation

LM3S102:  Luminary LM3S102 Evaluation board with ULINK debugger
          - Application is loaded to internal Flash.

Note: Jumpers JP22 .. JP26 must be installed and jumper JP1 
      on the Daughter Board must be set to short pins 2-3

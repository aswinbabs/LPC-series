The Blinky project is an example program for the 'AT91SAM9263'
using Atmel 'AT91SAM9263-EK' Evaluation Board and demonstrating
interrupt usage.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 2 LEDs blink (DS1, DS2)
 - time of LED switching is determined by Programmable Interrupt 
   Timer (PIT) working in interrupt mode

Clocks: Oscillator      =  16.367660 MHz
        PLLA            = 200.049178 MHz
        Processor Clock = 100.024589 MHz
        Master Clock    = 100.024589 MHz

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  SAM9263 Int RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM (80kB+16kB)
                     (used for target debugging)
  SAM9263 Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                     downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB)
                     (used for target debugging and production)
  SAM9263 Ext SDRAM - SAMICE: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                     downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB),
                     prepared to be downloaded and debugged with SAMICE
                     (used for target debugging and production)

Notes: 
  - For "SAM9263 Ext SDRAM" target if Debug is selected 
    the code is loaded to External SDRAM and debugging happens there, 
    if Download to Flash Memory is selected the code downloads to 
    External DataFlash Card
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "SAM9263 Ext SDRAM"
    version to work as standalone. This is done by opening 
    Bootloader project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" 
    button.

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on "Download to Flash Memory"
     button
  2. Select "SAM9263 Ext SDRAM" target in this project and 
     click on "Download to Flash Memory" button
  3. Reset the board

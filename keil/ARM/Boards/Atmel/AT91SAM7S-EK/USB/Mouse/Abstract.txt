The Mouse project is a demo program for the AT91SAM7S64
using Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK Microcontroller Board.

It demonstrates an USB Mouse based on USB HID.

Since there are only 4 Push Buttons (SW1..4) availbale
the following is used for Mouse movements and clicks:
  - SW1 selects between X (Left/Right) or Y (Up/Down) movement
    and also beetween Left or Right click
  - SW2 is used for negative movement
    Left (SW1 not pressed) or Up (SW1 pressed)
  - SW3 is used for positive movement
    Right (SW1 not pressed) or Down (SW1 pressed)
  - SW4 is used for clicks
    Left (SW1 not presed) or Right (SW1 pressed)

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - LED1 shows the SW1 state
  - LED3 is on when USB Device is configured
  - LED4 is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Mouse is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mouse driver.

The Mouse program is available for the following targets:
  AT91SAM7S-EK: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)

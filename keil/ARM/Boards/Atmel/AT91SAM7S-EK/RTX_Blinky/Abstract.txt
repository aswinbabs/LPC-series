This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Full step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:       uVision Simulator for evaluation

AT91SAM7S Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM, using ULINK
                 (used for production or target debugging)

AT91SAM7S RAM:   configured to run from on-chip RAM, using ULINK
                 (may be used for target debugging)

The Hello project is a demo program for the AT91SAM7S64
using Atmel AT91SAM7S Microcontroller Board.

It prints "Hello World" to the serial port and blinks
LEDs according to the push buttons on the board:
 - pressing SW1 prints "Hello World" and blinks LED1
 - holding down SW2 holds the main program 
   (except LED4 blinking) and lights LED2
 - pressing SW3 turns on LED3
 - pressing SW4 turns off LED3
 - LED4 blinks at 1Hz rate

The example shows:
 - how to setup the Vectored Interrupt Controller (VIC)
 - how to setup Interrupt Priority and Interrupt nesting
 - how to setup Periodic Interval Timer (PIT)
 - how to use the UART Interface
 - how to use the Parallel I/O (PIO) Controller

The Hello program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  AT91SAM7S Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  AT91SAM7S FRIRQ: configured for on-chip Flash ROM with
                   Fast IRQ functions located in on-chip RAM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  AT91SAM7S RAM:   configured to run from on-chip RAM
                   (may be used for target debugging)

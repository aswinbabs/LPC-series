The Blinky project is a simple program for the AT91SAM7A3
using Atmel AT91SAM7A3-EK Microcontroller Board.

It blinks the 4 LEDs on the board. The board's joystick
can be used to control the blinking speed (up/down),
the direction (left/right) and to invert (push) the blinking.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:             configured for software Simulator
  SAM7A3 Flash - ULINK:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM, using ULINK
                         (used for production or target debugging)
  SAM7A3 RAM - ULINK:    configured to run from on-chip RAM, using ULINK
                         (may be used for target debugging) 
  SAM7A3 Flash - SAMICE: configured for on-chip Flash ROM, using SAM-ICE

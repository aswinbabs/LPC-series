This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Full step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:  uVision Simulator for evaluation

AT91SAM7A3: Atmel AT91SAM7A3 evaluation board with ULINK debugger

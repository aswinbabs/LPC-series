The Blinky project is an example program for the 'AT91SAM9XE512'
using Atmel 'AT91SAM9XE-EK' Evaluation Board and demonstrating
interrupt usage.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 1 LED blinks
 - time of LED switching is determined by Programmable Interrupt 
   Timer (PIT) working in interrupt mode

Clocks: Oscillator      =  18.432000 MHz
        PLLA            =  96.109714 MHz
        Processor Clock =  96.109714 MHz
        Master Clock    =  96.109714 MHz

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  Simulator         configured for software Simulator
  SAM9XE Int RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM (32kB)
                    (used for target debugging)
  SAM9XE Int Flash: configured for on-chip Flash (512kB)
                    (used for target debugging and production)
  SAM9XE Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                    downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB)
                    (used for target debugging and production)
  SAM9XE Ext SDRAM - SAMICE: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                    downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB),
                    prepared to be downloaded and debugged with SAMICE
                    (used for target debugging and production)

IMPORTANT:
  - when board is used for the first time, after board is powered, 
    take J10 off for a short while, to reset RSTC_MR register and 
    then put it back on

Notes: 
  - For "SAM9XE Ext SDRAM" target if Debug is selected 
    the code is loaded to External SDRAM and debugging happens there, 
    if Download to Flash Memory is selected the code downloads to 
    External DataFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "SAM9XE Ext SDRAM"
    version to work as standalone. This is done by opening 
    Bootloader project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" 
    button.

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on "Download to Flash Memory"
     button
  2. Select "SAM9XE Ext SDRAM" target in this project and 
     click on "Download to Flash Memory" button
  3. Reset the board

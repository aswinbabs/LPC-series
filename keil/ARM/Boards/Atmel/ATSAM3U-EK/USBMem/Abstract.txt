The Memory project is a demo program for the AT91SAM3U4E
using the Atmel ATSAM3U-EK Microcontroller Board.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - PB0: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - PB1: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  ATSAM3U-EK: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)

The RTX_Traffic project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for Atmel AT91SAM3U microcontroller using Atmel ATSAM3U-EK 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing button (USR-LEFT)
that lets pedestrians cross.  

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization
   and operation code are in Traffic. Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  COM1 port settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Traffic program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:    - configured for software Simulator
  ATSAM3U-EK:   - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

The BlinkySimple project is a simple demo program for the Atmel 'AT91SAM3U4E' 
microcontroller using Atmel 'AT91SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - Main Clock            =   4 MHz

The BlinkySimple program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   configured for software Simulator
  ATSAM3U-EK:  configured for on-chip Flash
               (used for production or target debugging)

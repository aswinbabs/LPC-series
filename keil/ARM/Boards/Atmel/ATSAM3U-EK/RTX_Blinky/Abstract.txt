The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the Atmel AT91SAM3U microcontroller using Atmel ATSAM3U-EK 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. LEDs are blinking simulating the activity of the clock task.

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:    - configured for software Simulator
  ATSAM3U-EK:   - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

The HID project is a demo program for the AT91SAM3U4E
using the Atmel ATSAM3U-EK Microcontroller Board.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs (D2..3)
  - 2 Push Buttons (USR_LEFT, USR_RIGHT)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  ATSAM3U-EK: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)

The Blinky project is an example program for the 'AT91SAM9RL64' 
using Atmel 'AT91SAM9RL-EK' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
interrupt functionality and display to graphic LCD.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Displays rotating ARM 3D logo, each picture is displayed every 200 ms
 - 2 LEDs blink (DS1 and DS2) with speed of 1 second, determined 
   by Periodic Interval Timer (PIT) working in interrupt mode

Clocks: Oscillator      =  12.000000 MHz
        PLL             = 200.000000 MHz
        Processor Clock = 200.000000 MHz
        Master Clock    = 100.000000 MHz

The Blinky program is available for target:
  SAM9RL Ext SDRAM: configured for external SDRAM (64MB)
                    downloaded to external DataFlash (8.25MB)
                    (used for target debugging and production)

Important: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!   In EVAL version of uVision do not rebuild the target as !
!   this example's size exceeds EVAL version limitation     !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Notes: 
  - For "SAM9RL Ext SDRAM" target if Debug is selected 
    the code is loaded to External SDRAM and debugging happens there, 
    if Download to Flash Memory is selected the code downloads to 
    External DataFlash
  - Bootloader has to be downloaded to flash for "SAM9RL Ext SDRAM"  
    version to work as standalone. This is done by opening 
    Bootloader project and clicking on "Download to Flash Memory" 
    button.

How to start:
  1. Open Bootloader project and click on "Download to Flash Memory"
     button
  2. In this project and click on "Download to Flash Memory" button
  3. Reset the board

Picture conversion procedure:
  1. Convert picture to 24 BPP (B-8bits, G-8bits, R-8bits)
  2. Remove header from bmp by hex editor, remaining file size should 
     be equal to ((((width*3)+3)&~0x03)*height) bytes
  3. Convert prepared file without header to C array and include it 
     into project source files

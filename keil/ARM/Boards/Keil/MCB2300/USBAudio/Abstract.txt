The Audio project is a demo program for the LPC2378
using Keil MCB2300 board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Audio Device - Speaker.

The USB Audio Device is recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Audio driver and add a
speaker which can be used for sound playback on the PC.
Potentiometer on the board is used for setting the Volume
and the LEDs are used to display a simplified VU Meter.

The Audio program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2300: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J5 to 1[2 3] (jumper towards JTAG connector)
      for USB soft connect

The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the 
ST 'STM32F107VCT6' microcontroller using 
Keil 'MCBSTM32C' Evaluation Board.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL    =               25.00 MHz
 - PLL3    = (XTAL/5)*10 = 50.00 MHz
 - PLL2    = (XTAL/5)* 8 = 40.00 MHz
 - PLL1    = (PLL2/5)* 9 = 72.00 MHz
 - SYSCLK  = PLL1        = 72.00 MHz
 - HCLK    = SYSCLK      = 72.00 MHz
 - PCLK1   = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz
 - PCLK2   = HCLK        = 72.00 MHz
 - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6     = 12.00 MHz
 - SYSTICK = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz

Memories:
 - Internal Flash        - 256 kB (adr: 0x08000000)
 - Internal RAM          -  64 kB (adr: 0x20000000)

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  MCBSTM32C:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  MCBSTM32C + OPT: MCBSTM32C with Flash Options
                   (used for programming)

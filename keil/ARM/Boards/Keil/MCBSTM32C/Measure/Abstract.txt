The 'Measure' project is a demonstration program for the 
'STM32F107VCT6' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32C' Evaluation Board.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL    =               25.00 MHz
 - PLL3    = (XTAL/5)*10 = 50.00 MHz
 - PLL2    = (XTAL/5)* 8 = 40.00 MHz
 - PLL1    = (PLL2/5)* 9 = 72.00 MHz
 - SYSCLK  = PLL1        = 72.00 MHz
 - HCLK    = SYSCLK      = 72.00 MHz
 - PCLK1   = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz
 - PCLK2   = HCLK        = 72.00 MHz
 - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6     = 12.00 MHz
 - SYSTICK = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz

USART2 settings:
 - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

 - ADC
   - ADC1 channel14 connected to potentiometer POT1 

Memories:
 - Internal Flash        - 256 kB (adr: 0x08000000)
 - Internal RAM          -  64 kB (adr: 0x20000000)

Example functionality:                                                   
You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of the
Joystick (Buttons right, left, up, select) on MCBSTM32C evaluation board.

The Traffic program is available in different targets:
  MCBSTM32C:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

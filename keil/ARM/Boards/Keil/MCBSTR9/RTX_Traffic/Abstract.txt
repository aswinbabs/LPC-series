Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing
button (S3) that lets pedestrians cross.  The lights are
connected to Port 7. You can see this in action using
uVision Debugger. 

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization
   and operation code are in TRAFFIC.C. Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  Serial I/O is interrupt and event driven.  Look at
   SERIAL.C for the complete, encapsulated module (you
   may want to use this in your programs).


The TRAFFIC example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
           - watch the variables in Watch #1 window

MCBSTR9:   Keil MCBSTR9 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
           - Application is loaded to internal Flash.

           Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port using 
           HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 
           1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

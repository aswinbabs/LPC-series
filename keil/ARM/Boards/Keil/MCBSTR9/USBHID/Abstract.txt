The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTR9 Board
using a ST STR91x Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs
  - 2 Push Buttons (S2,S3)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTR9: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J3 to P3.7 for debugging

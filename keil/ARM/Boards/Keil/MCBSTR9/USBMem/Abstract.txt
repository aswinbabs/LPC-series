The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTR9 Board
using a ST STR91x Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - P7.0: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - P7.1: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - P7.2: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - P7.3: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTR9: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J3 to P3.7 for debugging

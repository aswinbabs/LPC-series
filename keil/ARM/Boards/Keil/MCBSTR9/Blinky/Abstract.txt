 - interrupt driven TIM3 timer (starts AD conversion)
 - interrupt driven AD convertor (reads conversion result)
 - text is displayed to character LCD
 - bargraph is displayed to character LCD, according to 
   potentiometer position
 - 8 LEDs blink from left to right
 - speed of blinking can be altered with potentiometer position

The Blinky program is available in target:
  STR910 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
  STR910 Flash 
      with CFG:  same as "STR910 Flash" + Flash Configuration
                 (OTP, User Code, Configuration, Security Bit)

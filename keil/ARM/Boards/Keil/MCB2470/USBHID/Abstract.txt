The HID project is a demo program for the LPC2478
using Embedded Artists boards:
  Daughter Board - 'LPC24xx OEM Board v1.1a'
  Mother   Board - 'OEM Base Board QVGA v1.1'

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs (LED1..4)
  - 4 Push Buttons (Button1..4)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following targets:
  MCB2470: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J37 to Lower Pos (enable via P0.14)

The Blinky project is an example program for the Zilog 'Z32AN11'
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBZ32AN' Evaluation Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - 8 LEDs blink
 - time of LED switching is determined by Timer 8 working in 
   interrupt mode
 - AD conveted value (potentiometer value) is shown in a form 
   of bargraph on Character LCD Display

Clocks:   Oscillator      =  24.000 MHz
          pll_clk         = 384.000 MHz
          fclk            =  96.000 MHz
          hclk            =  96.000 MHz

Memories: Internal RAM    - 64kB
          External Flash  -  4MB
          External SDRAM  - 32MB

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  Z32AN11 Int RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM (64kB)
                     (used for target debugging)
  Z32AN11 Ext Flash: configured for external flash (4MB)
                     (used for target debugging and production)

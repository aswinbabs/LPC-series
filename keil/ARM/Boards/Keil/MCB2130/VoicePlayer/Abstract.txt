The VoicePlayer project is a simple program for the LPC2138
using Keil MCB2130 Microcontroller Board.

It demonstrates the Digital/Analog Conversion capabilities
of the LPC2130 series. 

Severeal Audio Files are stored into the on-chip Flash ROM. 
The flash is organized into 8 blocks of each 64KB by the 
application . This allows each block to store 4 seconds of 
16-bit PCM-encoded audio data with 8kHz sample frequency.

Wave files are stored into a Hex-386 file with the BIN2HEX
converter. You can download it for free from www.keil.com:

Wave files can be replaced with any file, that is stored
in 16-bit PCM / mono / 8000Hz WAVE/RIFF format. Length is
automatically limited. Files and coversion batch are located
in ./AudioData/.

The VoicePlayer program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in software Simulator
  MCB2100 Flash:  runs from on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for target debugging and free-run)

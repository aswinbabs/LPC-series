The 'SVC' project is a simple program for the STM32F103RBT6 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board and shows how to 
implement software interrupt functions 
It includes the file SVC.c which implements the SVC handler.
The SVC function declarations and implementations are demonstrated
in the file Test.c.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz


It includes the SVC.c file which implements the SVC handler.
The SVC function declarations and implementations are demonstrated
in the Test.c file.
 
The SVC program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  MCBSTM32:    - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

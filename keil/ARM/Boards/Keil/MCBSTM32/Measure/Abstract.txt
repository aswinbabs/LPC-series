The MEASURE program uses analog and digital inputs to simulate a datalogger.

You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of S2, S3 Buttons
on MCBSTM32 evaluation board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - USART1 settings:
   - 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity

 - ADC
   - ADC1 channel1 connected to potentiometer POT1 
 

The program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   configured for software Simulator
               Serial Window #1
               ADC1 channel 1 simulated using a debug function.
  MCBSTM32:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)

It blinks the Go LED once per second and shows a bar graph on
the Red, Yellow and Green LED according to the analog voltage
from the potentiometer. The push button controls the Stop LED.

                  (runs from Internal Flash located on chip)
  MCBLM3S Trace:  configured for MCBLM3S Board with Trace
                  (shows variables AD_Value and Ticks in

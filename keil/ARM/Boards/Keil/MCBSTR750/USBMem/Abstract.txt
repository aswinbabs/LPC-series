The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTR750 Board
using a ST STR75x Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - P2.0: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - P2.1: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - P2.4: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - P2.5: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  MCBSTR750: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
             (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J2 to P2.15 for debugging

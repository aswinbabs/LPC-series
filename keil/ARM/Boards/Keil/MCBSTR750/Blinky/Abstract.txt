The Blinky project is a simple program for the ST750FV2T7
using Keil 'MCB-STR750' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             =   4 MHz
   - CK_SYS = CK_PLL1 =  60 MHz
   - HCLK   = CK_SYS  =  60 MHz
   - CK_TIM = HCLK/8  = 7.5 MHz
   - PCLK   = CK_TIM  = 7.5 MHz
 - TIM2 timer is activating LED and works in interrupt mode
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - text is displayed to textual LCD
 - bargraph is displayed to textual LCD, according to 
   potentiometer position
 - 8 LEDs state represent the potentiometer position
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator
  STR750 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  STR750 RAM:      runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (may be used for target debugging) 
				 
Note: To run from flash at boot, place jumpers BOOT0 and BOOT1 
      to position GND

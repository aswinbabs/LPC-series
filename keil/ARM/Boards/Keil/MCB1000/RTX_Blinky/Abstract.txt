The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC1343' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  72 MHz
   - USBPLL =  48 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  MCB1000:     - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

The 'ExtRAM' project is a simple program for the STM32F103ZE 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32E' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
external SRAM functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz



General description:
+++++++++++++++++++++

This example uses the external SRAM on the MCBSTM32E. A message is printed to the ITM printf Viewer when running in Debug mode.

There are two configured targets:

* ExtRAM: Initializes and tests the external RAM with a simple count value that is read and written.
* Run from ExtRAM: Initializes the ExtRAM via ExtRAM.ini, loads the application code into the external RAM and runs from there.

The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the ST32F103EZ 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32E' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz
 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
   - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - colour LCD display shows init message and bargraph 
   depending on potentiometer position
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART2 
   USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD is used with DMA or IRQ (see file Blinky.c)
   AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator
  STM32 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)
  STM32 RAM:      runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                  (may be used for target debugging) 
  STM32 Trace A:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                  configured for Trace (shows variables AD_DbgVal, 
                  \IRQ\SysTick_Hanlder\ticks and SFR USART2_DR in
                  Logic Analyzer)
  STM32 Trace B:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                  configured for Trace (shows only SFR USART2_DR
                  in Logic Analyzer including the first character in
                  packet which is followed very fast by the second
                  due to the UART HW transmit buffer)
  STM32 Trace C:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                  configured for Trace (shows variables AD_DbgVal, 
                  \IRQ\SysTick_Hanlder\ticks in Logic Analyzer and
                  the ITM printf output in the Serial-Wire Viewer)

The Blinky project is a simple program for the 'LPC2919' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB2900' evaluation board 
and demonstrating interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             =  10 MHz
   - PLL              = 160 MHz
   - SYS   = PLL / 2  =  80 MHz
   - TMR   = PLL / 2  =  80 MHz
   - FDIV0 = PLL / 40 =   4 MHz
   - ADC   = FDIV0    =   4 MHz
 - 6 LEDs blink from left to right and back
   (LEDs are connected to P1.24 .. P1.29)
 - speed of LED blinking can be changed by pressing 
   S1 (increased) or S2 (decreased) buttons
   (S1 - P1.30; S2 - P1.31)
 - Timer 0 is used for generating time for LED
   blinking, it works in interrupt mode
 - ADC2 (IN0) is used for getting AD value from 
   potentiometer POT1, it works in interrupt mode
 - Outputs AD value on UART0 every 1 second
   UART settings: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, 
                  no parity
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator
  LPC2919 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

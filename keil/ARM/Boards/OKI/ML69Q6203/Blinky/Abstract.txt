The Blinky project is a demo program for the ML69Q6203
using OKI ML69Q6203 Microcontroller Board.

It displays numbers on the 7-segment LED Display
(0, 1, ..., A, b, C, d, E, F).

The demo continues to count on the 7-segment LED Display
in an infinite loop. Pressing the SW3 (IRQ) button on the
board will reverse the counting direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ML69Q6203 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  ML69Q6203 IRAM:  configured to run from on-chip RAM
                   (may be used for target debugging) 
  ML69Q6203 SRAM:  configured to run from off-chip SRAM
                   (may be used for target debugging) 
  ML69Q6203 DRAM:  configured to run from off-chip DRAM
                   (may be used for target debugging)

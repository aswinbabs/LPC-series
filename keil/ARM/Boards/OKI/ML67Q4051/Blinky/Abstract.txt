The Blinky project is a demo program for the ML67Q4051
using OKI ML67Q4051 Microcontroller Board.

It blinks 3 LEDs and displays numbers on the 7-segment LED Display
(0, 1, ..., A, b, C, d, E, F).

The demo continues to count on the 7-segment LED Display
in an infinite loop. Pressing the EXINT1 button on the
board will reverse the counting direction.

Boards switches and jumper setting:

   RTCK        -> "ON" position
   SYSCLK SEL  -> "SYSTEM" position
   RS232C SEL1 -> "SIO" position
   RS232C SEL2 -> "SIO" position

   Notes:
    *1: Standalone Mode:  on-chip Flash (use Int. Flash target)
    *2: Standalone Mode: off-chip Flash (use Ext. Flash target)
    *3: Debug Mode: SRAM instead Flash  (use Ext. SRAM target)

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ML67Q4051 Int. Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                        (used for production or target debugging)
  ML67Q4051 Ext. Flash: configured to run from off-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)
  ML67Q4051 Ext. SRAM:  configured to run from off-chip SRAM which
                        is mapped instead of the off-chip Flash ROM
                        (may be used for target debugging)

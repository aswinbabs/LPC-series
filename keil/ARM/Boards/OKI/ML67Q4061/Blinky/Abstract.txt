The Blinky project is a demo program for the ML67Q4061
using OKI ML67Q4061 Microcontroller Board.

It blinks 3 LEDs and displays numbers on the 7-segment LED Display
(0, 1, ..., A, b, C, d, E, F).

The demo continues to count on the 7-segment LED Display
in an infinite loop. Pressing the EXINT1 button on the
board will reverse the counting direction.

Boards switches and jumper setting:

   RTCK        -> "ON" position
   RS232C SEL1 -> "SIO" position
   RS232C SEL2 -> "SIO"  position

The Blinky project is a demo program for the ML674000
using OKI ML674000 Microcontroller Board.

It displays numbers on the 7-segment LED Display
(0, 1, ..., A, b, C, d, E, F).

The demo continues to count on the 7-segment LED Display
in an infinite loop. Pressing the EXINT0 button on the
board will reverse the counting direction.

Boards switches and jumper setting:

   OSC SEL      -> SYSTEM      NORMAL -> ON
   RS232C1 SEL1 -> ENA         SA     -> OFF
   RS232C1 SEL2 -> ENA         ANGEL  -> OFF
   RS232C2 SEL  -> ENA         IAR    -> OFF

   VDD CORE -> SYSTEM
   VREF     -> SYSTEM
   AVDD     -> SYSTEM
   VDD IO   -> SYSTEM
   MODE0    -> L
   MODE1    -> H
   FWENA    -> ENA
   NEFIQ    -> ENA
   EXINT0   -> ENA

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ML674000 Flash: configured for off-chip Flash ROM with Boot SRAM
                  Runs from off-chip Boot SRAM which is mapped into 
                  Boot Region instead of the off-chip Flash ROM.
                  Memory image is the same as in stand alone mode
                  and can be programmed into the off-chip Flash.
                  Stand alone mode can be configured with jumpers
                  NORMAL -> OFF, SA -> ON
                  (used for production or target debugging)
  ML674000 SRAM:  configured to run from off-chip SRAM
                  (may be used for target debugging) 
  ML674000 DRAM:  configured to run from off-chip DRAM
                  (may be used for target debugging)

This is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the ML67Q4003
using OKI ML67Q4003 Microcontroller Board.

It displays numbers on the 7-segment LED Display
(0, 1, ..., A, b, C, d, E, F).

The demo continues to count on the 7-segment LED Display
in an infinite loop. Pressing the EXINT0 button on the
board will reverse the counting direction.

Boards switches and jumper setting:

   OSC SEL     -> "SYSTEM" position
   RS232C SEL1 -> "UART" position
   RS232C SEL2 -> "ENA"  position
